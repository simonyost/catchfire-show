Léonce B. Crump Jr. is no stranger to expectations. He grew up competing as an athlete and played college football at The University of Oklahoma, while majoring in Political Science, before joining the NFL. After a short NFL career, he became a community leader and pastor of Renovation Church in Atlanta.

This week Léonce joins us to explore the messy tensions of leading a diverse group through culture, political, and socioeconomic tensions toward a vision of unity.
