audiences pick up good things from people who talk at them, but I want to make sure that what I'm using my writing for is not just to yak. Takes out there, not just to eat, takes into the ether and, but to, but to share a little bit of my heart and my hurts and things that I like and the nerdy things that I care about and stuff like that.
