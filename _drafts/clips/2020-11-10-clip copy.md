I get  worried about that sometimes lately, especially with the, that we're re there's a whole generation who's coming of age, defining thing about their civic. Identity is that they don't like Donald Trump, which is very understandable. There's a lot of things not to like about the guy, but it makes me worried that when he goes away, what do you have?

cause he will someday eighth weather in November, four years there or, down the road at some point he's not going to live forever. And then what do we have left? And I want to make sure that the community that is building around can learn to pivot from just being. Never Trump anti-Trump to something that is positive and that can look like a lot of different things.

but it needs to look like something. And I'm worried right now that it doesn't, there's not a whole lot. There's not a lot of there.
