I've learned a lot about like leading with empathy from little things, especially teaching boys. I had a little boy who did his work on an exercise ball in the back of the room, because he literally was driven by a motor. And I was like, Oh, I understand what that means now. Okay. Sit on this ball and get out your wiggles that you need to get out, but it's not going to impede you from learning. let me change my expectations of what I feel like my classroom should be like to accommodate you. and it didn't mean lowering a bar. It meant shifting, this is actually going to help you be more successful.
