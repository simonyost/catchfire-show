CJ Brown of Sk8bort Productions is a skating entrepreneur working hard to bridge the gap between up-and-coming local businesses and more prominent, corporate skate brands.

### Quick Hits
- He has been skating for 9 years and started his brand, Sk8bort, in April 2020
- *Why did you start Sk8bort?* "In 2015, I transitioned from baseball. My Twitter name was YoupitchIhit because a baseball guy, I played DH. But I changed my name to Sk8bort, and that's how it all started. It was inspiration from Beyonce because in her song "Drunk in Love" she was like 'riding with my surfboard,' but nah, we skateboarding out here!"
- On skateboarding: "It's a sport, therapy, and hanging with your friends all at once"
