## Catch Fire Show with Simon Yost

Move past archetypes to find your prototype. The Catch Fire Show is a new podcast about dialing in on whom we want serve and then developing the skills to serve with passion.

The episodes will primarily be interviews with folks that are a few steps further in the journey to help us along.

We hope you will join us.
