   <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Courtney Orlando: </span><span class="c1">[00:00:00] My son asked me the other day ,
         &quot;what does a Grammy mean to two artists, dad?&quot; I was like, just take favorite sports team and
         their championship rings. You only get a few of those and in a lifetime, some people don&#39;t get none.
         They spend whole career would in a season where they get no, not a championship.&#39; And I&#39;m like,
         &#39;daddy got one at 32 years of age, so...&#39;</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c6">Welcome</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;[00:03:05]</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:03:05] Courtney, it&#39;s good to see you. Thanks for stopping by so to speak. In
         the land of COVID there&#39;s really no, or there&#39;s less like physical stopping by, some more virtual
         stopping by.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:03:18] </span><span class="c3">Courtney Orlando: </span><span
         class="c1">[00:03:18]
         Yeah.Yup. Yup.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:03:20]</span><span class="c4">Simon Yost: </span><span class="c1">[00:03:20] I
         view our relationship as special for a reason that is few on my list. And that is, I feel like we&#39;ve
         kind of got to watch each other grow sometimes from a distance, sometimes close up, and for me is for me a
         super special thing. So thank you for that privilege of being able to have a seat for that.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:03:40] Yeah, man. </span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:03:41] </span><span class="c3">Courtney Orlando: </span><span
         class="c1">[00:03:41]
         Yeah. Ditto.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c6">Where do you find yourself currently?</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;[00:03:42]</span>
   </p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:03:42] So, </span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:03:42] </span><span class="c4">Simon Yost: </span><span class="c1">[00:03:42]
         where do you find yourself in life right now? Can you just give us a little intro, what you&#39;re doing now
         and where you find yourself?</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:03:49] </span><span class="c3">Courtney Orlando: </span><span
         class="c1">[00:03:49]
         Yeah. I am finding myself the best, spiritual, mental, physical health of my life.
         Artistically, I am in the most innovative and the most inspired place that I&#39;ve been since...woof, since
         2013, 14. So I&#39;m feeling I&#39;m invigorated. I&#39;m feeling, just like, I&#39;m ready to run, ready to
         just &mdash;all the ideas, you know ? all the dreams, all the songs, all the melodies that has been bottled
         up in me through, you know, these last few seasons of my life, I feel like are now just ready to come out
         and they are, and it&#39;s they just, it&#39;s a, it&#39;s an outpouring right now so... But then again, in
         the midst of COVID, we are in the midst of, again, finding our country in the midst of social ills that are
         hurting us and we&#39;re losing people to this disease and we&#39;re losing people to unhealthy and
         systematically racist policing.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:04:54]So it&#39;s just so many matters, man violence, you name it. The
         disparities that COVID creates from the lack of jobs, so much, but in the midst of it all, I&#39;ve found
         sort of a solace in just God and my family, man, and my wife, man. She has been a rock for me and in these
         past few years of my life. So yeah, brother but yeah, I am midst of something amazing, but the tension is
         still there, ya know?</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:05:22] </span><span class="c4">Simon Yost: </span><span class="c1">[00:05:22]
         It&#39;s huge and I think &nbsp;acknowledging that tension&mdash;I&#39;m not saying I feel the exact same
         tension as you do, but&mdash;it&#39;s just like you get on Instagram, you&#39;re on the podcast&mdash; we
         want to produce content of value and so people can enjoy themselves, listen to this podcast, but the world
         we find ourselves in, there&#39;s a lot of brokeness and a lot of hope too. </span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:05:39]</span><span class="c3">Courtney Orlando: </span><span class="c1">[00:05:39]
         Yeah, man.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:05:40]</span><span class="c6">Starting Out...</span><span
         class="c1">&nbsp;[00:05:40]</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:05:40] </span><span class="c4">Simon Yost: </span><span class="c1">[00:05:40]
         Well, rewind. Talk a little bit about how you got started and what some of your road has been.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:05:45]</span><span class="c3">Courtney Orlando: </span><span class="c1">[00:05:45]
         Yeah, man. So, this is back when Myspace&mdash;I think the last year or so of
         Myspace&mdash; and it just goes to show y&#39;all long we&#39;ve been in this thing. But yeah, so, I was
         putting some music up on Myspace and I&#39;m kind of just working that thing, and I had beef. I was looking
         for artists that were local, but that were making music on the same level that I was, and at the time I was
         really&mdash;God was really building and cultivating with me in his heart for diversity&mdash;and just like
         my love, for all types of music. I fell in love with, rock music that year or that season, and then, more
         alternative music, I&#39;ve been introduced a Radiohead and some other people.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:06:28] And so I&#39;m, you know, looking at this band, Fundamental Elements, and
         hearing this sound, but then see I&#39;m like, &#39;these all white dudes singing&#39;, but it sounded so
         soulful. You know what I&#39;m saying? I was like, &#39;yo, this is dope,&#39; and so I followed them and
         now they ended up following me back and then I had just came-made the transition of taking the Christian
         moniker off of my social- my artists entities. So, I was no longer just, you know, referring to myself as
         J.R. Courtney Orlando the Christian Artist. I was just an artist, and so they were instrumental in putting
         me into that world, and helping me to really organically experiment inside of it and how God was using it by
         allow me, you know, they was like, &#39;yo, we&#39;ve been checking out your stuff, and we want to know if
         you can just do a couple of shows with us?&#39; And for me it was a perfect timing because I was trying
         transitioning from a faith based audience into now, just you know, wanted to make music on a more broader
         scale as far as my audience was concerned. And so, yeah, that&#39;s how we ended up. </span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:07:31] So we ended up rocking like four or five shows together. Been doing a
         couple of dates out of town and, just build a relationship with not only Russ, but also Luke, who was, Luke
         DeJaynes, who was one of the guitarist and songwriters, producers of that band as well.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:07:47]</span><span class="c6">From Small Begingings to the Grammys</span><span
         class="c1">&nbsp;[00:07:47]</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:07:47]</span><span class="c4">Simon Yost: </span><span class="c1">[00:07:47] And
         so as many of us&mdash;small beginnings&mdash; you&#39;re starting from a grassroots level, but &nbsp;then
         there was the Grammy. So before I knew you too long, you went to the Grammy&#39;s, and I think you take your
         son, and you gotta accept a Grammy for producer of the year? Is that the- was that the award?</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:08:03] </span><span class="c3">Courtney Orlando: </span><span
         class="c1">[00:08:03]
         No, it was-no, so my Grammy was for my work on the artist Lecrae&#39;s record called
         Gravity. And so, I was part of a production team on that record called The Watchmen, and I also produced and
         featured on the title track &#39;Gravity&#39;. And that album ended up winning a Grammy. So producers,
         songwriters, engineers that contributed to the record, all were Grammy winners that day.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:08:31]</span><span class="c4">Simon Yost: </span><span class="c1">[00:08:31] And
         so, how&#39;d you feel about that award? </span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:08:33] </span><span class="c3">Courtney Orlando: </span><span
         class="c1">[00:08:33]
         Oh, it is definitely a highlight of my career. Still to this day. And to have my son,
         &nbsp;Keenan&mdash; who is 21 now, but he was 16 at the time&mdash; to have him there to experience that was
         pretty dope. Because I know, musicians who were in circles around me and artists and writers who were in
         circles around me who have yet to have a Grammy . &nbsp;And so I&#39;m not saying that I don&#39;t deserve
         it cause I put it in a lot of work and my 8,000 plus hours, and have been nominated for Grammy&#39;s, two or
         three other times, but to really see that project, that you was a part to help to get to this point, you
         hear that Grammy belongs to, and you&#39;re a part of it. It&#39;s yo. It&#39;s like a Superbowl. </span>
   </p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:09:15] My son asked me the other day. Liam, he was like, &#39;yo,&#39; he was
         like, what does a Grammy mean to two artists, dad? And he was like, &#39;what is like, how do I weigh that?
         And I was like, &#39;well, I was like, just take favorite sports team and their championship rings. You see
         what I&#39;m saying? You only get a few of those and in a lifetime, some people don&#39;t get none. They
         spend whole career would in a season where they get no, not a championship.&#39; And I&#39;m like,
         &#39;daddy got one at 30, 33 at 32 years of age, so&hellip;&#39;</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c6">How do you follow up from a Grammy?</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;[00:09:46]</span>
   </p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:09:46] </span><span class="c4">Simon Yost: </span><span class="c1">[00:09:46]
         That&#39;s awesome. So you have a lot of highs in your career and we could talk about many more, but then
         kind of just to get practical with everybody listening. An artist&#39;s biggest&mdash;I don&#39;t know if
         biggest fear&mdash;but a fear is kind of coming back after you&#39;ve created great work, and I know
         recently, you&#39;ve talked about some work that&#39;s going to see the light of day, and you&#39;re really
         proud of, and some work that you&#39;ve kind of had t o consider maybe keeping a little bit more private or
         somethi ng &nbsp;Talk about how you&#39;re coming out of that success and where you find yourself
         today?</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:10:18]</span><span class="c3">Courtney Orlando: </span><span class="c1">[00:10:18]
         Yeah, so, </span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:10:19] fast forward from that </span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:10:21] </span><span class="c3">Courtney Orlando: </span><span
         class="c1">[00:10:21]
         glorious day, </span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:10:23] and you </span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:10:24] </span><span class="c3">Courtney Orlando: </span><span
         class="c1">[00:10:24]
         come out of-when you win a Grammy, </span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:10:26] like one of the things that I was, </span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:10:29] </span><span class="c3">Courtney Orlando: </span><span
         class="c1">[00:10:29]
         conscious of was not becoming </span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:10:32] complacent. Like I had arrived, because even </span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:10:35] </span><span class="c3">Courtney Orlando: </span><span
         class="c1">[00:10:35]
         though I had a Grammy, I </span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:10:36] had a Grammy for a record that </span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:10:39] </span><span class="c3">Courtney Orlando: </span><span
         class="c1">[00:10:39]
         still&mdash; </span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:10:41] I think that at </span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:10:42] </span><span class="c3">Courtney Orlando: </span><span
         class="c1">[00:10:42]
         that moment it had only barely went gold. </span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:10:45] I don&#39;t even think it wouldn&#39;t go yet, even though it ended up
         going, </span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:10:48] </span><span class="c3">Courtney Orlando: </span><span
         class="c1">[00:10:48] I
         think sold like 500,000 </span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:10:49] copies of something like that , but you know, little radio play, a little
         exposure to TV. It was a Christian hip hop album.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:10:58] </span><span class="c3">Courtney Orlando: </span><span
         class="c1">[00:10:58]
         So if anybody thinks that, you know, people who make music, it&#39;s only a small
         percentage, probably 10% or less who do music who call themselves a Christian Hip Hop Producer or artist
         that actually make across that six digit number in while doing music. It&#39;s just. It&#39;s just not
         lucrative, you know what I&#39;m saying? </span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:11:19] Not then and still not now, because it&#39;s just such a small monopoly of
         record labels and content creators that make that level or have that type of following. So I had that
         Grammy, but my pockets wasn&#39;t laced. , If I won a Grammy, like for Kanye, you see what I&#39;m saying?
         Or for Jay Z, because those albums are selling, 10 times platinum, you know what I&#39;m saying?</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:11:41] Seven times, five times platinum and you get ,millions and streams, of
         course, in revenue off one record take you-last you two or three years. So I wasn&#39;t complacent. I was
         like, I gotta get back to work. So that the Grammy, I will look at it and be like, I&#39;m looking at it
         now, my studio and then just be like, &#39;Oh, okay&#39; and get to grinding as if I didn&#39;t have a
         Grammy. But little did I know though, is that for me, it wasn&#39;t like the Grammy was the least of my
         worries are learning how to, deal with success. So that, wasn&#39;t what plagued me on those following
         years.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c6">Series of Traumatic Events...</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;[00:12:14]</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:12:14] What plagued me was a series of traumatic events that I could not predict
         that shook me to my core and where music could not help, or was very little help at certain times through
         this journey. So that was 2013. The greatest-the highest &nbsp;pinnacle of my life, my professional life,
         2014. I have&mdash;I get into an accident that almost took my life.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:12:40] If I didn&#39;t have my seatbelt on... That was in may of 2014. So I&#39;m
         like,&#39;okay everybody gets into accidents.&#39; I had 50 stitches over my eye. I&#39;m like,
         &#39;it&#39;s cool&#39;. Fast forward to July, took my whole family, it&#39;s 20 of us, my parents, all of
         my family, my brother, his family, my brothers, and then my brother&#39;s wife&#39;s family. We all go to me
         and my wife timeshare in Orlando. &nbsp;First day of that vacation, my wife has a miscarriage. The second
         day I have a heart attack, and so this was one of the starts of some traumatic experiences that as a person
         of faith, you try to make sense of it all. You&#39;re trying to make sense, Oh, okay. Back to back blows
         like this&mdash; and we have been trying to have kids for years and so that, but no&mdash;I think we were
         miscarriage number three or number four at that time.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:13:33] So it was painful, but not as painful of my wife having to rush me to the
         hospital cause I can&#39;t breathe. You know having these chest pains, palpitations, and then, come to find
         out I&#39;m having a heart attack at 34. You see what I&#39;m saying? That was 2014. My, my best friend at
         the time, Eric, Eric Brown.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:13:54] And he was like, &#39;bro, you want me to, fly down there, man?&#39; he
         was like, &#39;I got you. I was like, nah, bro, I&#39;m good. And he was like, &#39;it ain&#39;t nothing,
         bro. I can cook. I can be down there then a couple hours.&#39; I&#39;m like, &#39;I&#39;m goochie&#39;. Lo
         and behold, 2015, I would get a call from his wife saying that he had passed from a heart attack and he was
         only 33.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:14:13] So you take that 2015-2016, I have another heart attack while I was
         working out like Eric was. Lo and behold, that wasn&#39;t caused by new blockage, thank God, it was caused
         by the stint failing prematurely. 2017, I get a call while leading worship at church and my father dies of a
         heart attack.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:14:38]I go to the house. He&#39;s still dead on the ground. Go through that whole
         ordeal. 2018, my wife&#39;s father who was living in our home, and we knew he was going to pass because he
         had cancer. It was terminal. He passes in our home, 2018. Later on that summer, my mom has a quadruple
         bypass. So dealing with blow after blow, and then winning a Grammy while at the top of my career, I&#39;m
         making some good money, and when these heart attacks and these other traumas hit, it also hit my ability to
         create. So my income is cut in half.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:15:19] So, take all of that, all of those that didn&#39;t. &nbsp;Not knowing how,
         not knowing, the typical toxic masculinity is to not talk about these things and to be like, Oh, I&#39;ll
         get over it.&#39; And especially with African American males, we just like trauma is supposed to happen to
         us.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:15:36] So we get used to dealing with it and we hide it and it hurts us. You see
         what I&#39;m saying? It comes out in other ways that are more harmful, and so I didn&#39;t even know that I
         was depressed until I looked at anything I tried to put my hands to, I couldn&#39;t. Anything I started, I
         could not finish. I lost motivation and inspiration in things that I love to do just as quick as I got that
         inspiration, as quick as I would lose inspiration for it.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:16:01] And so started seeing a counselor and, seeing him for about eight months
         now, and it&#39;s been life altering. And so for me, winning that at grammy, if that was a pinnacle, then in
         the valey of the shadow of death was waiting for me. They know those following next five to six
         years.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:16:19] And so, praise God, this now where I&#39;m at now. Praise God, that in
         March or April, March, and I had a breakthrough and I just woke up and God gave me life and I wanted to
         live. I was not suicidal anymore. The world just looked beautiful, and so out of that, I&#39;ve been back to
         myself, recording, back in the gym, lost 25 pounds, and our new home is getting renovated and family is
         good. I can&#39;t complain. Can&#39;t complain. So, I&#39;m learning what this new, what that season was
         meant. I&#39;m still learning how God is going to use it, and all I&#39;m doing now is just telling him my
         story, of me going through it.</span></p>
   <p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c6">What play does music and creativity have coming out of the trauma?</span><span
         class="c1">&nbsp;[00:16:58]</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:16:58]</span><span class="c4">Simon Yost: </span><span class="c1">[00:16:58] So
         when you look then at, I guess the place that music has in your life, how do you feel like it has taken a
         different spot now? Like your creative energy where your inspiration has that any of that change changed
         since?</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:17:15] </span><span class="c3">Courtney Orlando: </span><span
         class="c1">[00:17:15]
         Absolutely. So I didn&#39;t have inspiration. I&#39;ve been working on two projects in
         the last, two years or so. One is called, The Fight of Our Lives, which is now 85% done. It&#39;s about 16
         tracks, and it&#39;s a project around social justice and social ills. But then the second one was, Things
         Below, and that was the project about this depression.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:17:37] And so, the last couple of years, the only thing I can really sing about
         was those two things. I haven&#39;t written any songs, any epistles to the church. I haven&#39;t written any
         songs about love, nothing. I&#39;m just writing about sorrow and ills, you see what I&#39;m saying?</span>
   </p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:17:53] Because that was what flooded my psyche, and also the mystery of faith and
         mystery of being a person of faith and the notion of guidance and scripture and absolute truth, all those
         things that they play their part in it, and my song writing too. But coming out of that, I still am singing
         about this journey through depression, but it&#39;s from a different point of view, that makes sense.</span>
   </p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:18:20]So this is not so much as, as a person currently suffering at that level,
         or this idea of hopelessness is which was really heavy on the first &nbsp;version of this record. But now
         it&#39;s more of really kind of telling the story, and I could find myself telling my story and being
         totally authentic to the process, but without sounding like I&#39;m pitying myself or, you know what I&#39;m
         saying? Or I&#39;m building a song. that is building its foundation on hopelessness. This just has a, more
         of a tone of hope, and it has more of a tone of storytelling and allowing of the listener to put themselves
         in my shoes, if we share the same experience. But the greatest emotion that I felt that what has come to me
         more than anything is the story of love.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:19:08] The story of &nbsp;a broken heart and know, me, myself. I refer to Coco,
         my wife, as my second salvation because God has used her. And even when I couldn&#39;t hear Him, he&#39;s
         spoken through her and she&#39;s my, greatest, I can&#39;t find another word to articulate it.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:19:30] If it wasn&#39;t for her, I would be dead. I would be dead and I&#39;m a
         hundred percent sure of that. And so I write a lot about the love and the life that she gives me. The grace
         that she&#39;s shown me, the truths that she&#39;s shown me about myself. And I&#39;ve been writing a lot
         about the heartache of, a lot of my friends who have been married 15, 16 years, &nbsp;and have called it
         quits or have cheated on their husbands or cheated on their wives or been physical or mental abuse or...
         it&#39;s just also, I&#39;ve had a chance to pass there and walk along rock alongside people who have
         experienced great heartache. And so I want to tell their stories and I want to tell my own stories of what,
         the notion of love, and how for one person it could be bliss, another person, it can be a nightmare, </span>

   <p class="c0"><span class="c6">Leading with a Limp</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;[00:20:22]</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:20:22] </span><span class="c4">Simon Yost: </span><span class="c1">[00:20:22]
         Sometimes when professionals are interviewed, there&#39;s this idea of them as a professional and of them as
         like a person or a man. And I am privileged to know you in both, but also a third dimension. And I don&#39;t
         know&mdash;I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s just three dimensions&mdash; but there&#39;s this other dimension
         where I&#39;ve seen you carry communities on your back.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:20:40] I&#39;ve seen you care for people in ways that I just, I don&#39;t know if
         I even have the, I would even have the capacity to wade into. And so I&#39;ve just gotten to see you lead
         people and love people in a way that is... yeah, it is amazing, and I just wonder when you&#39;ve been going
         through all this stuff, personally, and it&#39;s so traumatic, how do you sort through how to put your
         energy, where to put your energy?</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:21:06] Cause so many people rely on you for so much?</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:21:09] </span><span class="c3">Courtney Orlando: </span><span
         class="c1">[00:21:09]
         Yeah, I think that was part of it. So when we talk about leadership and it&#39;s
         leaders lead with the limp. And I think that just comes along with leading. You don&#39;t-you&#39;re strong.
         You try to stay strong until you can no longer, until it becomes a thorn and you have to step back.</span>
   </p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:21:30] But you bear certain burdens that the people you&#39;re leading may not
         have to worry about their time and, that&#39;s part of leadership. But I think what is toxic and what&#39;s
         been harmful is when leaders try to lead as if they are gods, and as if they are invincible, you know what
         I&#39;m saying? and we&#39;re not.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:21:47] And a lot of us lead to the point to where, when God says, &#39;Hey, I
         need you to slow down, take a break.&#39; We go past that, and then we wonder when we blow up, and whether
         that be, you doing something crazy out of character or blowing up in anger or frustration, or the shame
         comes in, whatever it is. Whatever it comes from, we were putting on too much weight.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:22:10]Whatever the repercussions of that, I think we fall victim to that way more
         than we are actually called to an ex. It should be expected to. So for me, I think, me leading in the season
         where I was dealing with so much personal trauma was, both a gift and a curse because one, anybody who deals
         with depression know that if you can find something that removes you out of your own head and puts you in a
         space where you&#39;re serving genuinely, and you&#39;re distracted from the voices, then that&#39;s a good
         thing. </span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:22:38] The other thing is that when you can get so busy doing that you&#39;ve
         never doubled back to go 10 to your mental, spiritual own wellbeing, and so for me, I think I bit the bullet
         most definitely, but that&#39;s why my, the sabbatical that I took was so important because it, let me let
         go of everything except for the main thing.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:22:59] And that, for me, it was. Being able to preserve my faith, preserve my
         life, and preserve my family, and preserve my mind. So now I lead a small group of people, but as for a
         singular purpose and that&#39;s just, they&#39;re helping me to put out this music and to start my brand and
         to make sure I&#39;m faithful to that, because that&#39;s what God has called me to in this season.</span>
   </p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:23:21] So, yeah, it flows and I know I got the same hardships that comes from
         leading, but nothing that doesn&#39;t come with the job. Do you see what I&#39;m saying? So it&#39;s a-I got
         a nice balance right now.</span></p>

         But for, justice for, when we&#39;re talking about black bodies in particular,
         we&#39;ve never been restored. So if we call ourself a Christian nation, and yes, we were pinning for
         slavery, yada, even though so we know systemic and, unethical issue, steel plate, the Western part of the
         world. Part of God&#39;s plan for restoration of repentance is whatever you took from them you got to give
         that back. And so I look at my people when you wonder why, the blacks are the face of the lesser than.
         That&#39;s why we&#39;re murdered like we are, because it&#39;s been it&#39;s in the DNA of this
         country.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:26:19] You are a slave. You will always be beneath me, bro. You know what I&#39;m
         saying? Like you were like, you just recently got free. Your people just recently-and some of y&#39;all
         still can&#39;t vote. So all of this, what you&#39;re looking at, the looting, the rioting&mdash;I don&#39;t
         approve none of that stuff&mdash;but it&#39;s hard to condemn a language of a people when they have-when you
         can&#39;t-when they&#39;re not being heard in any other way.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:26:45] And it makes no sense, right? You, &#39;Oh, you hurt me. So I&#39;m gonna
         go burn down my house.&#39; It doesn&#39;t make sense, but people who don&#39;t know how to articulate that
         they&#39;re like, it&#39;s like a child and a child throwing a tantrum. So I&#39;m not making, giving,
         making any excuses. But I&#39;m saying I understand. But if you look at that, if you look at poverty, if you
         look at all the ills of what we think the average American will say, plagues our community, you will find it
         with someone who is in poverty or someone &nbsp;from European culture was say, it&#39;s the blacks, the
         black on black crime and them. But all of that Simon, we can trace back to slavery. So justice to me says
         one, you recognize that you took something from us. Scripturally, if you are Christian, says that you have
         to now restore what was taken and that&#39;s never been restored to us.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:27:45] Why? Because the price is too damn high to restore what you&#39;ve taken
         from us. It would be trillions of dollars. It would be land. It would be so many things undone unturned, and
         it is the cost is too high. So I don&#39;t get excited for that stuff. I&#39;m grateful for small baby
         steps, but this will always be America&#39;s plague until it fully repents fully restores. You can&#39;t
         hold onto power. You know what I&#39;m saying? And restore at the same time. You got a release-you
         go-it&#39;s got to cost you something. And I just think for justice for this country, I think is too great
         of a cost. True justice for this country, I think it&#39;s too great of a cost.</span></p>

         Yeah, so then like, that&#39;s corporately and that&#39;s super important. Inner personally for me in my
         relationships, for example, is there any way that I can bring this to bear in some way that even if I&#39;m
         just offering smaller amounts of this?</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:28:53] </span><span class="c3">Courtney Orlando: </span><span
         class="c1">[00:28:53]
         Yeah. Yeah. I would say&mdash; I know it&#39;s funny, cause we, had this talk with
         some friends of mine as well, white brothers of mine&mdash; so the first thing, every human being should be
         implored to do is to love your neighbor as yourself, right?</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:29:09]That seems like a basic principle. Like you love your neighbor as yourself,
         but when you&#39;ve been taught that you are above your neighbor, whether you be white, no matter your
         color. If you make more money than your neighbor, then there needs to be, or if you only live on the West
         side, And then those people on the East side, or the North side and like those barriers, economic status,
         like that makes us not be able to look good neighbor and say, I love you as myself, no matter what you look
         like or what you don&#39;t have of have.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c6">Benefit from Whiteness</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;[00:29:40]</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:29:40] So first I would say, we love our neighbor as ourselves. The second thing
         is that the sooner of my white brothers and sisters realize that they benefit from whiteness, and that it is
         a concept that was created to create race. It was created, the concept of race and separatism. The sooner
         you recognize that, the sooner you&#39;ll start understanding the systems from what you benefit from every
         single day, those same systems have trap doors in them for my people, you see what I&#39;m saying? </span>
   </p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:30:15] They have systemically been designed to make sure that you are always on
         top and our people are always on the bottom. I can&#39;t say this enough, if for anybody that&#39;s out
         there and wants to understand the dynamics of in our race in this country and even how faith plays in it,
         check out Jamar Tisby &quot;The Color of Compromise.&quot; He paints out all of American history and the
         ways we are complicit in the face of slavery. How ways still in the seventies and eighties and nineties,
         that politicians were creating ways different languages to put instead of saying nigger&mdash; I think it
         was one of Truman&#39;s associates or something like that, but it was like, &#39;we can&#39;t say nigger
         cause he&#39;s that hurts us.&#39;</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:31:01] But he was saying it, if you take that and exchange that for red lining or
         for these other terms, then we keep them at a disadvantage. This is what&#39;s happening in the system of
         whiteness. You see what I&#39;m saying? And as soon as we start understanding that system was set up to
         benefit one and oppress another, you will continue having the same blind spots, and even when you think
         you&#39;re helping, you&#39;re hurting. You see what I&#39;m saying? </span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:31:25] And so I would say, but you&#39;re already doing this with your family.
         You&#39;re doing this with your faith and you were doing this with your work. And of course here, you know
         what your art. So, but yeah, I would say the normal person who is of European descent understanding in this
         country, whiteness is everything. You see what I&#39;m saying? It&#39;s everything. Even when you don&#39;t
         even know it exists, you know what I&#39;m saying? You benefit from his existence.</span></p>

         Okay. Cool. Yeah, cause I&#39;ve been like trying to read, Ibram&#39;s &quot;Stamped From the

         &#39;Okay, this is this is going to be some months. It&#39;s just so dense.</span></p>

         class="c1">[00:32:22]
         Yes. Man. Yeah. you already know it, bro. Knowledge is the key to everything. Most of
         the stuff I&#39;ve learned about my people and about this country, 90% of it I didn&#39;t learn in the
         classroom because it wasn&#39;t taught to us . Most of them, I had to go dig and get it.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:32:36] And so to my white brothers and sisters, you do the same thing. You know
         what I&#39;m saying? You got internet just like me. And so I can own mind shooting suggestions, but
         educating, we all gotta educate ourselves on this. You know what I mean? </span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:32:50] </span><span class="c4">Simon Yost: </span><span class="c1">[00:32:50] You
         have the internet, just like me. I like that. I&#39;m going to use that on my teenagers. I was with a friend
         of mine. This is a huge tangent with our toddlers the other day, and he asked his kiddo, if she was going to
         eat yet and she said, no, I&#39;m not hungry and he was like, &#39;you mean, I haven&#39;t asked you to eat
         yet?</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:33:06]That&#39;s why he didn&#39;t eat yet, and I&#39;m like, I need to save that
         one. Cause I&#39;m going to get, be getting some backlash. &nbsp;So I&#39;m like trying to create a catalog
         of all these toddler comebacks, Cause you literally feel like you&#39;re negotiating with a
         terrorist.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:33:19]You know? It&#39;s like you have nothing to lose. </span></p>

   <p class="c0"><span class="c6">Memory Work</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;[00:33:24]</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:33:24]</span><span class="c4">Simon Yost: </span><span class="c1">[00:33:24] This
         is kind of a brainstorming thing &nbsp;I was reading about it a couple of years ago about this idea of
         memory work. Actually I heard about it on the &quot;We Live Here,&quot; podcasts, the NPR St. Louis.</span>
   </p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:33:33] </span><span class="c3">Courtney Orlando: </span><span
         class="c1">[00:33:33]
         Okay. Yeah. Yeah. </span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:33:35] </span><span class="c4">Simon Yost: </span><span class="c1">[00:33:35] And
         the example that they shared was happened in North Carolina and I believe, and it was a racially, motivated,
         murder in the nineties, I believe. And maybe a decade after they used a concept called Memory Work, which is
         just kind of a hoity-toity word for saying that they in a-they gathered the community together.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:33:55] I think it was through some kind of speaking at events and they tried to
         merge the real story of what happened with the kind of public remembrance, because it wasn&#39;t the same.
         Yeah, the folklore wasn&#39;t the same. And so they&#39;re trying to take the real facts and insert them,
         and to make a true narrative.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:34:15]And so I just wondered from your perspective, St. Louis 2020, obviously we
         can&#39;t all gather in a auditorium cause of COVID right now, but, but when we can, what are some of those
         narratives that you feel like, either narratives or what style and posture do we need to come together? Like
         how do we start doing this together? Just kind of in a brainstorming...</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:34:39] </span><span class="c3">Courtney Orlando: </span><span
         class="c1">[00:34:39]
         Yeah, no. First, I forgot it was a director-movie director. He was just like, he was
         like, man, everybody&#39;s going through something. Everybody&#39;s going through something, so try to be
         kind, you know what I&#39;m saying? And that&#39;s a lighter sentiment, right? That says, just be
         empathetic, learn how to be sympathetic.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:34:58]And we need that. I forgot. the doctor -scientist that&#39;s, gave this
         quote, but he was saying humans&mdash;at the study&mdash;he was saying, humans are way more, efficient in
         dishing out harm than we, then we are receiving harm. You know what I mean? So we can dish out evil way more
         than we can be sympathetic and empathetic and enter into someone else&#39;s pain.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:35:25]And of course we know that, we believe that, but I feel like you start with
         emploring every man that, you know,-human being to love your neighbor as yourselves. You start there and
         then you say, what does that mean? So the same way you love your daughter, same way you love your wife the
         same way you love your family, your brother and your sisters that same love we are called to try to
         duplicate with our neighbor, right? Not on the same level because we know time and, it&#39;s been in the
         same space and getting to know someone builds that type of love. But that same foundation of saying you are
         intrinsically of worth because you are human, just like me.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:36:07]You deserve the same equity in life the same as me. And so if we start
         there, Simon, that&#39;s automatically going to say, Hey, if I&#39;m loving you, I love myself or the people
         around me than that means I can&#39;t ignore the things that may be happening to you or around you and vice
         versa.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:36:31]So let&#39;s take, for instance, a narrative is when, if you see black
         lives matter or someone like out there&mdash;I support black lives matter&mdash; but then I can&#39;t also
         support police officers. That&#39;s a lie, that&#39;s a stigma right there that a lot of people may get
         mixed up with people who are protesting that they&#39;re anti-police. No, I have family members who are
         policeman.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:36:51]We know my brother works for the government, so I understand the value, but
         we&#39;re not talking about, police officers in themselves. We&#39;re talking about the systemic issues that
         plague, the office of a policemen. If anybody knows their history of what police came from, it is rooted in
         slavery.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:37:10]After the civil war-after the &nbsp;reconstruction, former slave owners,
         we&#39;re afraid of retaliation and some retaliation had started or had been pockets of that. So they
         created a task force of people to guard those slave owners from potential people who want to,
         retaliate.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:37:28] And that then that spin into them creating law where know where we&#39;re
         now you have find, even now today&mdash;Ferguson was guilty of this&mdash;where the policing was issuing out
         of-so you would get these, misdemeanors, not misdemeanors, these fines that you really couldn&#39;t pay for.
         And so then that person, we know Mike Milton, does that work with the bail project, but, you have given
         somebody an $800 fine, and then they&#39;re like, I can&#39;t pay this, cause they poor. So then they go to
         jail, and after being in there for a week and then they get fired. Then they don&#39;t have a job and then
         they get kicked out and then they get on drugs or they rob you. You see what I&#39;m saying?</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:38:09]So we&#39;re not saying-no police officers. Policing is a good thing, but
         the way that it&#39;s been set up for certain people is not right. The police officer that were shot the
         other day in Tower Grove. That was a horrible situation! And I tweeted out prayers goes out to those police
         officer families. You know what I&#39;m saying?</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:38:27] May God bring justice quick. You see what I&#39;m saying? There is no
         substitute for-what is evil is evil, what&#39;s good is good. So I think us getting on a level ground where
         we say we&#39;re human. We endure the same heartaches and the same joy, the same aspiration. How come that
         some people seem to have more heartache than others? How come some people seem to have it better than
         others? We&#39;ve got to talk about those disparities, right? Because there&#39;s no use- Jesus said this,
         how can I tell somebody, go farewell and be well and be merry on your way, if I knew they were hungry and I
         had food, I didn&#39;t give it to them. So I can&#39;t wish someone well and say that I love you.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:39:05] I want to come together. If I can&#39;t the issues that I can currently
         see that are harming you or your people, or that they&#39;re harming me or my people. You see what I&#39;m
         saying? So I think we&#39;ve got to love our neighbor as ourselves. And then we got to talk about if that-if
         you-if it is true that you love your neighbor as yourself, that means you want equity. The same equity you
         have, you want your neighbor to possess, and then once you start to take that journey, you&#39;re going to
         see that, wow, this is not a fair, equitable part of the world for brown, poor people.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:39:39] And you know what I&#39;m saying? There is a bottom and it&#39;s not just
         people who just made poor financial decisions. It&#39;s something greater than it. And so I guess to say
         that as we&#39;re brainstorming, it goes back to the repentance. Without undoing and recognizing that there
         was a system at hand that is hurting our neighbors and allowing other neighbors to flourish then the healing
         can&#39;t begin.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:40:06] We see that in scripture. Healing can&#39;t begin unless there is
         repentance, but then repentence follows a number of things that needs-a number of things need to happen
         before true repentence is &nbsp;fleshed out. </span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:40:18] So we&#39;ve got to stop doing evil. Almost don&#39;t want to start
         preaching here. As we see in Amos in Isaiah stop doing evil. Learn to do good. Correct the oppression
         against the widow, the orphan, and the foreigner, and then we&#39;ll see what it means for us to come
         together. You see what I&#39;m saying? But if we&#39;re ignoring issues, if we&#39;re acting like issues
         don&#39;t exist and we&#39;re saying, &#39;I don&#39;t see it.&#39; And that goes for all &nbsp;types of all
         ethnicities. &nbsp;If you&#39;re not taking a look at self, if you&#39;re not taking a look at what is
         naturally genuinely evil, and what is genuinely good. Know. Okay. If you can&#39;t look in the mirror first,
         you won&#39;t be able to see what&#39;s plaguing or hurting your brother either. </span></p>

         And it&#39;s the people that I look at that are embracing and embodying love it seems to be that there&#39;s
         a couple of clicks out, like it&#39;s their nuclear family and themselves, and a couple clicks out, and
         there&#39;s some diversity in there, but it&#39;s because they&#39;re including more than themselves in
         their nuclear family in that thought process.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:41:49] There&#39;s - and when there&#39;s a little bit of diversity in there,

         Absolutely and I see I&#39;ve seen this, on from both, whites and blacks and Asians,
         but, one of my former neighbors I remember him having a talk about some of the guys in the neighborhood and
         I was approaching him and I was like, yeah, I had a talk with a young man down the street that was
         responsible for some of the break-ins, and it went real well. And he was like-and I was like, &#39;man, what
         these young dudes need-they need to see older men- these young people, young men who don&#39;t have fathers.
         They need to see older or more mature men. speaking into their lives. Helping giving them wisdom and
         knowledge and helping them to take the correct and positive steps in life. And his response was, &#39;man, I
         don&#39;t give a fuck about none of them.&#39; And he was like, &#39;all I care about is my own.&#39; And
         that is-that&#39;s toxic, and that is evil in itself. Cause it may have a false identity of someone who is
         trying to just steward his own. But when there are issues that go outside of your home, that affect homes
         that look like yours. You can&#39;t just say, I&#39;m just going to worry about my home because one day it
         may be your home that needs someone like me. You see what I&#39;m saying? And so we can never just say
         I&#39;m very- just worried about mines. When we live in a world where decisions are being made that affect
         not just our neighborhood of ultimately affect us like voting.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c6">Voting</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;[00:43:26]</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:43:26] You know what I&#39;m saying? I can&#39;t understand people who don&#39;t
         vote. You see what I&#39;m saying right now? It&#39;s not about the perfect candidates. It&#39;s about the
         lesser of evils. If we are going to move forward-we think do we want to die out at a faster rate or do we
         want a slower rate of mortality?</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:43:43] You see what I&#39;m saying? We want a slower rate, and depending on who
         we have in power will escalate us in our country and our values towards that-what we want to be. But I
         can&#39;t just stay at home and say, I&#39;m not voting because I don&#39;t like this particular candidate.
         Because that worldview says, yeah, you are okay with not putting in a vote, but &nbsp;what you should be
         worried about is what your vote will do in a greater aspect. You see what I&#39;m saying? If a person that
         is proven not to be able, fit to lead our country, or lead whatever municipality or state governor, whatever
         level. If you stayed at home and say, I&#39;m just going to worry about mine, that you say, screw you to the
         other people who have, who you have to live with.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:44:28] And I can&#39;t do that. I&#39;m always thinking about my neighbor. You
         see what I&#39;m saying? That&#39;s why God does not want us to just care about ourselves because that&#39;s
         a small world because someday you&#39;re going to need somebody to care for you. And what if that person had
         the same mentality, you will be just be shit out of luck. You see what I&#39;m saying? </span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:44:45] So, yeah, it&#39;s all hands on deck. All hands on deck. You can&#39;t
         ignore loving your neighbor. This is what has kept innovation, communities, neighborhoods, and nations
         alive, because there are things in place to make sure that we are growing in light of all of us, and not
         just a particular set of people.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c6">Not too far away from grave injustice</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;[00:45:09]</span>
   </p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:45:09] </span><span class="c4">Simon Yost: </span><span class="c1">[00:45:09]
         Yeah, I was jarred. I don&#39;t remember if it was &quot;The Color of Compromise&quot; or something else,
         but somebody said, how are things going with&mdash;I don&#39;t, I forgot diversity, social justice&mdash;
         and they&#39;re like, well, the good news is that we&#39;re not killing each other anymore over ideological
         differences.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:45:26]Like all of the stuff that happened and for hundreds of years, and it&#39;s
         just okay. You might be able to like, kind of pertition slavery out of your mind, but like the French
         revolution, all this kind of stuff, like honor, and even with World War I was kind of almost the near end of
         it.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:45:40] And then I read an article the other day that the guillotine was used in
         France as late as like the 1980s or something. And it&#39;s just it&#39;s just okay, let&#39;s just not get
         too ahead of ourselves. Like we are not too far away from things that we would consider grave
         injustice.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:45:56] </span><span class="c3">Courtney Orlando: </span><span
         class="c1">[00:45:56]
         And that anybody who could make that statement is an unlearned person in that
         particular context or whatever the issue is. You see what I&#39;m saying? And so we know that this thing is
         alive and well, man, alive and well. It just starts with an undoing evil. Stop, doing evil, learn how to do
         good.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:46:20] Bruh,if we all did that with our families and with our neighbors-do you
         know how beautiful of a place-the only reason whites are taught to hate blacks and blacks are taught to hate
         whites is because we open up that door. You see what I&#39;m saying? Like we opened up,
         before-pre-colonization, like we mad loved each other. You know what I&#39;m saying?</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:46:41] It may be like how you love each other because we&#39;re a community. You
         see what I&#39;m saying? But if you didn&#39;t know me, I didn&#39;t know you, I would assume that you are
         lying yourself with whiteness and you probably would assume if I had my beard out and kept earrings that you
         would be like, &#39;I don&#39;t know if I can trust him.&#39; You see what I&#39;m saying? Because of just
         how our world has been set up. The narrative! But that didn&#39;t have to be, but it is what it is. Cause it
         was .</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:47:07]</span><span class="c4">Simon Yost: </span><span class="c1">[00:47:07] Like
         that Dr. Seuss Snitches book. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever read that, but it&#39;s just like the
         Snitches, one had a star and one didn&#39;t and then it was like, &#39;Oh, the star!&#39; And this is like
         random thing, Oh, a star is going to make the difference.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:47:20]</span><span class="c3">Courtney Orlando: </span><span class="c1">[00:47:20]
         Yeah, and of course &nbsp;it&#39;s a lot of things that play into that and
         philosophically then, you align on, but the fall is the fall man, and I get it. I get it, but, Yeah.</span>
   </p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:47:31] </span><span class="c4">Simon Yost: </span><span class="c1">[00:47:31]
         Cool. Well, I can&#39;t tell you how much joy it brings me to talk to you. But also when I&#39;m in the car
         and we&#39;re playing music and my kids are like, cause my kids are teenagers. We&#39;re not, I don&#39;t
         want to give the impression that they&#39;re little kids and they&#39;re like dad put on Courtney&#39;s
         stuff. It&#39;s just yes! And it&#39;s just fun to be able to follow you and know you and cheer you
         on.</span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:47:51] Right on </span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:47:51] </span><span class="c3">Courtney Orlando: </span><span
         class="c1">[00:47:51]
         brother. </span></p>
   <p class="c0"><span class="c1">[00:47:52] Oh man. It&#39;s a pleasure brother. Pleasure, man. I pray- well, I think
         I&#39;m grateful for the opportunity, and my desire is that this show would literally catch fire. You know
         what I mean? That you would, in some way of form, this would be a stepping stone to what&#39;s next? What
         I&#39;m saying your career, but then, so I appreciate it, bro.</span></p>
