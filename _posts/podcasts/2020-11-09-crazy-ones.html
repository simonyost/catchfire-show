<h2>What are we reading?</h2>
<p>This week we discuss <a href="https://amzn.to/3e2oDYw">When Breath Becomes Air</a> by Paul Kalanithi. It's a memoir the publisher summarizes well:</p>
<p>"At the age of thirty-six, on the verge of completing a decade's worth of training as a neurosurgeon, Paul Kalanithi
    was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next, he was a patient
    struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated."</p>
