I am a novice compared to the masters who inspire me.

From his Casio 76 keyboard to acceptance to Berklee College of Music in Boston to contributing to the "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" reboot's musical score, Royce Martin has caught fire over the past several years.

Royce Martin is a pianist and composer currently attending the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Royce taught himself the piano at the age of 14 on a small keyboard. He has a rich musical background and an affinity for a myriad of genres from classical to jazz to popular contemporary. Royce has a working knowledge of many musical traditions and their historical context and is able to compose and perform accordingly. Over the past three summers, Royce worked as a pianist and lecturer, speaking to the long and storied history of ragtime and American music at the Scott Joplin State Historic Site in St. Louis where he received stellar reviews and attracted the attention of local news on multiple occasions. Fall 2020 brought Royce national attention when he was tapped to score "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Reunion" show for HBO-MAX. While Royce has been the recipient of many nominations and awards, he remains humble with the understanding that he is but a novice to the masters who inspire him. Now he continues on his path of musicianshipâ€”always in pursuit of the sonic sweet spot where his artistic skills meet the kaleidoscope of his vision.
