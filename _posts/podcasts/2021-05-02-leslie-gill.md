Having served in leadership capacities for several profit and non-profit organizations, Leslie Gill has been deeply involved in a wide range of social welfare issues. Before joining Rung as the organization’s president, Leslie Gill served as the Chief Executive Officer of Annie Malone Children’s & Family Service Center.

Prior to her role at Annie Malone, Leslie served as Executive Director of College Summit, where she had multi-state responsibility for programs, fundraising, and business operations. Prior to that, she spent six years in executive leadership roles with the Girl Scouts in St. Louis and Atlanta. In those roles, she oversaw advocacy and governmental affairs, strategic planning, program development, membership recruitment, and cookie sales.

Leslie is a native of St. Louis and now resides in the Central West End neighborhood with her daughter, Marley. She is a distinguished alumnus of Hampton University. She holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from Hampton University, as well as a Master of International Business from St. Louis University. Coupled with years of experience in executive leadership positions, Leslie is well-equipped to lead Rung and help further its mission to empower women.
