Kanika Sharma is the Tech Lead for the Modern Software Practice at 1904labs. Kanika puts her heart and soul into her work, as it has been her passion since high school.

Her proudest career achievement is designing, implementing, and maintaining the “Limits Management Platform” for Market Risk traders. She was a founding member of the team that migrated an ancient system & created a handcrafted workflow engine for the 200+ traders across the globe, a very high-impact project used by C Suite level executives to manage billions of pounds of market limits determining the bank’s risk appetite.

Kanika and her family live in St. Louis, Missouri.
