David is a Software Developer in Residence, focusing on the alignment of innovation and human flourishing. He supports general initiatives and Hypothesis projects with an eye towards technology ethics, team formation, and expansion of product benefits across stakeholders.

Joining Preston-Werner Ventures in 2020, David has experience across industries as a multi-disciplinary entrepreneur. He has received medical device patents, acted as an Investment Bank CTO, and authored predictive models guiding $100s of millions in investment and R&D initiatives for the Fortune 50. He studied mechanical and biomedical engineering at the University of Colorado before graduate study in philosophy at Oxford.

The ebullient, happy center of his life includes his beautiful wife, twin daughters, and son. They are often adventuring together amongst the playgrounds, trails, and gardens of Golden Gate Park. Otherwise, he can be found on a bicycle wandering the hills of the Marin Headlands.
