Welcome to the catch fire show, podcast about zooming in past the archetypes to the prototype. We want to get past all the "shoulds" to your passion and how you want to serve others.

We have to get specific about who we want to be-- more specific then choosing an archetype or a hero. We have to zoom in further...
