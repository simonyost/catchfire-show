<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="lead">Are you in search of the perfect job? The perfect tasks to fit your passion?</p>

<p>This week Todd Henry, a five-time author and founder of The Accidental Creative, challenges us with our idea of the perfect job. He believes a myth that our society holds is that we will find tasks that we will enjoy all day. Todd thinks the ideal job is the job one that enables you to achieve the outcome you desire, even if you don't love all the tasks that you have to do all day. His challenge:</p>

<blockquote>"What if you brought your motivation to your tasks instead of relying on your tasks to bring you motivation?"</blockquote>
      
<p>Todd's new book, The Motivation Code, aims to help each of us discover the hidden forces that drive our best work. The research in The Motivation Code began in the late 1960s and includes the largest repository of achievement stories in human history.</p>
