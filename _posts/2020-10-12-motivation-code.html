<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="lead">Are you in search of the perfect job? The perfect tasks to fit your passion?</p>

<p>This week <a href="https://www.toddhenry.com">Todd Henry</a>, a five-time author and founder of <a href="https://accidentalcreative.com">The Accidental Creative</a>, challenges us with our idea of the
      perfect job. He believes a myth that our society holds is that we will find tasks that we will enjoy all day. Todd
      thinks the ideal job is the job one that enables you to achieve the outcome you desire, even if you don't love all
      the tasks that you have to do all day. His challenge:</p>

<blockquote>"What if you brought your motivation to your tasks instead of relying on your tasks to bring you
      motivation?"</blockquote>

<p>Todd's new book, <a href="https://amzn.to/35DxHPS">The Motivation Code</a>, aims to help each of us discover the hidden forces that drive our best work.
      The research in The Motivation Code began in the late 1960s and includes the largest repository of achievement
      stories in human history.</p>

            <p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span>[00:01:30] </span><span class="c3">Simon Yost: &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Todd,
                        thanks for joining us today. You&#39;re over in Cincinnati, is that right? </span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span>[00:01:34] </span><span class="c1">Todd Henry: </span><span class="c2">[00:01:34] Yeah,
                        that&#39;s correct. Yeah. We, I think we just set a record for the only team in the history of
                        the Major League to be kicked, to be booted from the playoffs without scoring a single run or
                        something. Yeah. We&#39;re still a little heartbroken over that, and I know you guys are in St.
                        Louis, right? You&#39;ve had a little more success, but the Reds are coming up on your heels, so
                        just be careful.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span>[00:01:54] </span><span class="c3">Simon Yost: </span><span class="c2">[00:01:54] And
                        the Cubs, but yeah, it&#39;s baseball is crazy. And then the Bengals, do you have [00:02:00] any
                        hope this year, or are you, do you follow up Bengals?</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span>[00:02:02] </span><span class="c1">Todd Henry: </span><span class="c2">[00:02:02] I have
                        hope every year, but it&#39;s like Lucy with, in Charlie Brown with the football. This is the
                        time I&#39;m going to kick the football, and she snatches it back to the last minute. And
                        that&#39;s what it&#39;s always like with the Bengals, but listen, I love. Sorry, I don&#39;t
                        want to dive in like a whole sports thing here, but I love, I love Joe Burrow and his energy,
                        and I just love the way that they&#39;re really rebuilding this team around a new ethic, and so
                        I&#39;m hopeful for the future. I am.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span>[00:02:23] </span><span class="c3">Simon Yost: </span><span class="c2">[00:02:23]
                        That&#39;s cool. We, I found you several years ago, maybe circa 2003, &nbsp;when you started
                        your podcast; I tuned into my dorm room. Does that sound about right?</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span>[00:02:34] </span><span class="c1">Todd Henry: </span><span class="c2">[00:02:34]
                        Probably been about 2005 maybe is when, yeah. That&#39;s when the show started in earnest.
                        That&#39;s when I started producing episodes.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span>[00:02:40] </span><span class="c3">Simon Yost: </span><span class="c2">[00:02:40] So I
                        remember opening up my, one of the first Mac books I got, and opening up iTunes and searching
                        for creative podcasts, and Accidental Creative was the first one I latched on to. And I have
                        learned a ton since then. And, so I think, October 7th, the release of the &quot;Motivation
                        Code&quot;. Mark, your fifth book, is that correct?</span></p>
            <h3>Fifth Book in Ten Years</h3>
            <p class="c0"><span>[00:02:58] </span><span class="c1">Todd Henry: </span><span class="c2">[00:02:58]
                        Here&#39;s my fifth book in the last ten years. Yeah. So &quot;The Accidental Creative&quot; was
                        released in 2011. So this will be the fifth book in ten years. Yeah. Which is crazy when you put
                        it that way. But, yeah, it&#39;s a, it&#39;s been a pretty fun run. And, the good news is that
                        when you research, and this is true of any kind of creative work, when you research, when you
                        write, when you&#39;re doing the work itself reveals, whatever the next work is going to
                        be.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:03:19] And so that&#39;s been the case for all of my books, is that as
                        I&#39;m researching and writing, I&#39;m discovering things that are like threads. I want to
                        pull, but I can&#39;t pull them now; I have to pull them later. Cause they don&#39;t have, they
                        don&#39;t fit into this book, or they don&#39;t fit into this project, whatever it is.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:03:33] And so I just set them aside, and that becomes the next thing that
                        I work on. So each book has led to the next, in that way.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span>[00:03:39] </span><span class="c3">Simon Yost: </span><span class="c2">[00:03:39] Oh,
                        that&#39;s great. Cause I think for me, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s many themes of your work and
                        your one-liners, &quot;Cover bands don&#39;t change the world ,&quot; things like that. I
                        remember a lot, but it seems like one of the themes is &quot; How to stay healthy as a create
                        on-demand professional&quot; and then &quot;How to lead teams, so they&#39;re healthy&quot;. And
                        when I saw the new title, &quot;Motivation Code&quot;, it struck me. Oh, like normally,
                        [00:04:00] those type of people have just like this overwhelming drive or intrinsic motivation.
                        And so how&#39;d you come across this idea, to bring the &quot;Motivation Code&quot; into the
                        next work?</span></p>
            <h3>Why the topic of motivation?</h3>
            <p class="c0"><span>[00:04:10] </span><span class="c1">Todd Henry: </span><span class="c2">[00:04:10] Yeah.
                        So about four years ago, a friend of mine, Rod Penner, who was a twenty-year veteran of a
                        management consulting firm, contacted me out of the blue. And he had left the management
                        consulting firm years before, but I didn&#39;t know what he&#39;d been working on since then.
                        And he said, &quot;Hey, I&#39;d like you to take this motivation assessment I&#39;ve been
                        working on.&quot;</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:04:27] And, I don&#39;t know about you, Simon, but when I hear
                        &quot;assessment&quot;, my eyes start to roll in the back of my head, and I think, &quot;Great!
                        I need another set of letters to attach to myself.&quot; But listen, I trusted Rod, so I took
                        the assessment, and quite frankly, what I discovered absolutely blew me away.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:04:41] Absolutely blew me away! I saw at the end of taking the &quot;M
                        Code Assessment&quot;, &quot;Motivation Code Assessment&quot;, the reason behind a lot of my
                        decisions I&#39;ve made in my life, why certain kinds of work energize me, other kinds of work
                        doesn&#39;t energize me, even though it&#39;s the opposite for many of my peers and my
                        friends.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:04:57]New areas of conflict in my life, why they exist and how I might be
                        able to move beyond them. Really, just so many things were laid out in front of me. And I
                        realized at that moment; I wanted to get this work into the world, to let other people
                        experience it as well. There was a small problem, though, and that was that I was already under
                        contract and in the middle of writing my other book called &quot;Herding Tigers&quot; that came
                        out in 2018. I&#39;ve been working on this book in the background for about four years, working
                        on it with Rod and Dr. Todd Hall and Dr. Joshua Miller, and really pulling this together, and
                        leveraging there over fifty years of research into this topic.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:05:29] And, so &nbsp;finaly, now after four years, the book is ready to
                        be put out in the world where it belongs and &quot;Motivation Code Assessment&quot; is finally
                        gonna be put out there where it belongs, and I&#39;m really excited to see what happens.</span>
            </p>
            <h3>What was it like presenting another&#39;s research?</h3>
            <p class="c0"><span>[00:05:41] </span><span class="c3">Simon Yost: </span><span class="c2">[00:05:41] Do you
                        feel like - this might be a secret- but do you feel like there&#39;s any bits that have leaked
                        out in talks that you&#39;ve given or things like that throughout the years?</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span>[00:05:51] </span><span class="c1">Todd Henry: </span><span class="c2">[00:05:51] Yeah.
                        For sure that, the funny thing is it&#39;s like the fun thing about the whole thing is that
                        while it&#39;s based on, as I mentioned over fifty years of research, it began really in the
                        [00:06:00] late 1960s , and was conducted over the course of all that time with top leaders in
                        the industry, really people from all walks of life.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:06:08]It&#39;s always fun to come in as an author and be able to put your
                        own unique spin on it. And what&#39;s funny is that even before I was exposed to all of this,
                        I&#39;d written a chapter on motivation in &quot;Herding Tigers&quot;, where I talked about
                        three profiles based on the work of another friend of mine, David Wiser, where he had talked
                        about builders, fixtures and optimizers, as three kind of profiles. And the funny thing is that
                        those align really closely with some of the motivational themes that we discovered in
                        &quot;Motivation Code&quot;. Yeah, so again, you kinda see that work carrying forward into this
                        book, that some of those themes really continue to apply to this work as well.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:06:44] But, but yeah, it&#39;s, it&#39;s always hard to work on. I
                        struggled to work on multiple big projects at the same time, which is why I put it, I was
                        working on in the background, but I put it on hold until I had locked the manuscript for
                        &quot;Herding Tigers&quot;. And then it was full guns blazing from that point on.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span>[00:06:59]</span><span class="c3">Simon Yost: </span><span class="c2">[00:06:59]
                        Especially with, books are huge projects and there&#39;s a lot of threads, so to speak in just
                        one book, let alone. Multiple. I can&#39;t even imagine.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span>[00:07:07] </span><span class="c1">Todd Henry: </span><span class="c2">[00:07:07] Yeah,
                        for sure. And you want to make sure that each book is its own thing. It&#39;s its own idea set.
                        You want to make sure that books aren&#39;t cannibalizing from one another, that there
                        aren&#39;t too many overlaps. And if you&#39;re writing multiple books at the same time, you
                        can&#39;t help, but have your mind to go in the same direction for both of them.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:07:22] And that&#39;s just not a good thing. You want to make sure the
                        book is going where it needs to go, not where you needed to go so that you can, so you can
                        actually write it at that moment in time.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span>[00:07:30] </span><span class="c3">Simon Yost: </span><span class="c2">[00:07:30] Yeah.
                        It&#39;s like the opposite of a movie script, like trilogy movie scripts or something, or
                        so.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span>[00:07:35]</span><span class="c1">Todd Henry: </span><span class="c2">[00:07:35]
                        Exactly.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span>[00:07:35]</span><span class="c3">Simon Yost: </span><span class="c2">[00:07:35] So I
                        haven&#39;t even had the chance to take the &quot;M Code Assessment&quot; yet, but would you
                        mind sharing any takeaways that you had when you took the assessment? Did you notice any changes
                        in your interactions with folks or the way</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span>[00:07:47] </span><span class="c1">Todd Henry: </span><span class="c2">[00:07:47] Yeah.
                        So really, what we&#39;ve discovered and what the assessment does, is it identifies as
                        twenty-seven unique themes of motivation. And those twenty-seven themes live within six
                        families. So just like [00:08:00] you have similarities with your biological family, right? Like
                        my sister, my biological sister and I have similarities in our DNA.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:08:07]You might be able to tell that we&#39;re siblings if you saw us
                        together, but we&#39;re very different in terms of our personality and how we play out. In the
                        same way, these motivational themes share some DNA with other themes. So we put them into
                        families, but they&#39;re very different in terms of how they play out in practice.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:08:23]We really focus on the theme level in terms of identifying
                        &nbsp;what your motivation code is. Your motivation code is our, the motivation code we defined
                        it as your top three to five themes, and how those themes affect you and how they interact with
                        and interplay with one another.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:08:39] So my top themes, for example, my very top theme is something that
                        we call &quot;Make an impact&quot;, and &quot;Make an impact&quot; means that I am driven to see
                        impact from my work. That&#39;s what I really want at the heart of it. So if I don&#39;t see the
                        direct impact from the work that I&#39;m doing, then it&#39;s hard for me to stay engaged, hard
                        for me to stay motivated.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:08:57] So you can imagine in the time of COVID how that&#39;s playing out
                        for me right now, where I&#39;m used to speaking on stage in front of thousands of people, and
                        now, all of a sudden, I&#39;m speaking into a camera to people and I can&#39; t see them.I&#39;m
                        like, three or four at a time, if I&#39;m doing it over zoom or something.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:09:11]But it&#39;s not the same as being in a room with a bunch of people
                        and seeing the tangible impact of my work. So I&#39;ve had to adapt my expectations and my work
                        to make sure that I am seeing impact because one of the, what we call the shadow side attributes
                        of that motivation, you, every motivation is a gift, but there&#39;s also a shadow side, and one
                        of the shadow sides is that sometimes people driven to make an impact, try to make an impact,
                        even more, it&#39;s not welcome. So if I don&#39;t see the impact of my work, I might start
                        trying to make an impact where I&#39;m not necessarily welcomed. And one way that happens, for
                        example, like if I&#39;m invited into a meeting where I&#39;m just supposed to sit in the back
                        and just audit the meeting or something, I guarantee you within seven minutes, I&#39;m standing
                        at the whiteboard with a marker in my hand, already like mapping out, &quot;Hey, what if we did
                        this?&quot; or &quot;Hey, let&#39;s try it!&quot;, just because that&#39;s such a part of it, of
                        who I am. My number two motivation is what&#39;s called &quot;Meet the Challenge&quot;,
                        [00:10:00] meaning I like concrete, discreet challenges that allow me to feel like I&#39;ve
                        overcome something in the short term.So long arc projects, like writing a book, don&#39;t
                        challenge me. I don&#39;t feel challenged by that because it&#39;s such a long arc project. I go
                        looking for short term challenges in the midst of that.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:10:18] So I might sit down and crank through my email inbox. And yeah, it
                        really charges me up when I really need to be writing.But the reason I do that is because it
                        feels like a challenge to me to get through my inbox. Versus writing. I&#39;m like,
                        &quot;I&#39;ve got a year or two&quot;, that doesn&#39;t feel challenging to me.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:10:31]What I&#39;ve had to do is structure my work so that, even like my
                        book writing is a series of mini challenges. I&#39;ll tell myself, &quot;I need to write that
                        five hundred words by 9:30 this morning&quot; in order to make it feel more challenging to me.
                        And once I do, I feel engaged, I feel invested, because I don&#39;t like to write. It&#39;s not
                        something I enjoy doing, but yeah, but bringing that motivation to my writing reframes it
                        completely. So that&#39;s an example of, and then my number three is &quot;Influenced
                        behavior&quot;. So I want to see other people, like right now you&#39;re nodding as we&#39;re
                        speaking, and that like really charges me up because I see that you&#39;re kind tracking with
                        me.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:11:04] Sometimes people will accuse me. This is part of the shadow side.
                        People will accuse me of saying the same thing over and over, &quot;You&#39;ve said the same
                        thing five times!&quot; I&#39;m saying, &quot;I know, but I&#39;m just waiting for you.&quot;
                        You acknowledge to me that it got through, cause I want to influence behavior.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:11:16] That&#39;s how I&#39;m wired now. Those are my top three and they
                        all interact with one another. But some people, for example, maybe one of their top three is
                        &quot;Collaborate&quot;, meaning that right now, they&#39;re really is struggling because
                        they&#39;re probably working from home. They&#39;re probably not in the team setting very often,
                        and even though they might jump on Zoom, this Zoom call feels very transactional. And so maybe
                        work that once really charged them up, doesn&#39;t quite charge them up the same anymore because
                        they&#39;re not able to be with other people, or some people are driven by what we call
                        &quot;Serve the serve&quot; motivation. It&#39;s really hard to serve people when you&#39;re not
                        right next to them, when you&#39;re not in proximity to them, and so, some people are being
                        robbed of some of the natural circumstances that lead to [00:12:00] activating those
                        motivations. And so once we understand how we&#39;re wired, what it is that drives us, where we
                        get our motivational energy, we can begin to structure our lives and our days and our
                        interactions in a way that activates that motivational energy, and we bring our motivation to
                        our tasks instead of waiting for our tasks to motivate us.</span></p>
            <h3>Do writers enjoy writing?</h3>
            <p class="c0"><span>[00:12:30] </span><span class="c3">Simon Yost: </span><span class="c2">[00:12:30] So one
                        of the topics of this podcast we wanted to bring is &quot;charting non-traditional career
                        paths&quot;. And I don&#39;t think we have time, unfortunately, to go through your whole story,
                        but you said something a minute ago that really struck a chord with me.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:12:40] And that is that writing wasn&#39;t one of your favorite things to
                        do. And I&#39;m around a lot of people that are just kinda &quot;When I could do&quot;,
                        &quot;When I get to this point&quot;. And I&#39;m just going to be honest: sometimes I look at
                        you, and you&#39;re one of my heroes, and I&#39;m like, &quot;Oh, if I could speak like
                        Todd!&quot;. I mean talk about, since you don&#39;t like writing, why is it such a big part of
                        what you do?</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span>[00:12:59]</span><span class="c1">Todd Henry: </span><span class="c2">[00:12:59]
                        It&#39;s, it is because it&#39;s the best way for me to achieve the impact that I so desire. I
                        love speaking because that&#39;s a very tangible, concrete thing where I can immediately see the
                        impact of my work, cause I&#39;m speaking directly to people and I can see them reacting to what
                        I&#39;m saying.</span></p>
            <p class="c0 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p>
            <h3>Writing is a great way to get ideas into the world...</h3>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:13:15]But writing is a great way to get ideas into the world. It&#39;s a
                        great way for people to digest what you&#39;re thinking. And it&#39;s really the most concise
                        way to do that. And that is really, it&#39;s a vehicle that I chose to achieve the outcome that
                        I want, even though it&#39;s not necessarily a task that I enjoy, that I love.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:13:33]And so I think sometimes one of the myths that we have in our
                        society is that we wait to find tasks that we think we&#39;re going to enjoy all day. And
                        that&#39;s what the perfect job is. And I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s true. I think the perfect
                        job is the job that enables you to achieve the outcome you desire, even if you don&#39;t love
                        all the tasks that you have to do all day.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:13:51]Yeah, I think that&#39;s the very definition of having passion for
                        your job. And while I, listen, and I tell myself this all the time, I don&#39;t like to write,
                        but I&#39;m [00:14:00] not out digging ditches or, do, there are a lot of the things and
                        that&#39;s, sorry, that&#39;s the go-to. I don&#39;t, I&#39;m not meaning to disparage digging
                        ditches, but that&#39;s the go-to slog work because you have to do it, whether it&#39;s hot or
                        cold, or raining or dry, or whatever, like you&#39;re out there digging the ditch.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:14:13]But in many ways, like that&#39;s what it feels like to me when
                        I&#39;m writing. It&#39;s &quot;Okay, let&#39;s crank it out.&quot; I mean, right now, I&#39;m
                        in book launch mode. I&#39;m cranking out articles for all these publications and seven hundred
                        words here, and nine hundred words there, and just on all kinds of topics.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:14:27] And, it&#39;s not my favorite thing in the world to do, but I
                        realize on the other side of that is going to be impact that I&#39;m going to love. And so
                        that&#39;s what keeps me, keeps me moving forward. So we can&#39;t fall prey to the idea that
                        the perfect job is a job, but we just enjoy the tasks. We&#39;re going to enjoy some of the
                        tasks, of course, and maybe over time we gain more flexibility to really structure our life
                        around just the tasks that we want more and more, but we have to earn that. We have to earn, and
                        nobody has a job where they only get to do what they want to do all day. Instead, we need to
                        look for a job that gives us the ability to have the impact that we want on the other side.
                  </span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span>[00:15:00] </span><span class="c3">Simon Yost: </span><span class="c2">[00:15:00]
                        Something else that I&#39;m hearing and, take us in the right direction here, but there&#39;s a
                        scale with this impact. &nbsp;Even the pre-COVID versus now, like I&#39;m in the office all day,
                        and I might have a series, even just a few conversations that might seem to be high impact. Or,
                        when I look back on my day, it might be like, &quot;Oh, this is where I really connected with
                        someone.&quot; Or this is where we really pushed the ball forward. When you are saying,
                        &quot;Oh, remind yourself of the impact that your work is going to have&quot;, but it&#39;s so
                        corporate, it&#39;s so big .You&#39;re pushing it out to thousands and thousands of
                        people.</span></p>
            <h3>Connecting with a big impact.</h3>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:15:32] What are some of the ways that then you reconnect with that
                        impact?</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span>[00:15:36] </span><span class="c1">Todd Henry: </span><span class="c2">[00:15:36] Yeah.
                        It&#39;s really good question. For me, numbers don&#39;t really mean a lot, I know the podcast I
                        do is downloaded millions of times a year, and those numbers don&#39;t really mean anything.
                        They mean a lot to our advertisers, but they don&#39;t really mean a lot to me personally, cause
                        it&#39;s not just about numbers, it&#39;s about the impact that I&#39;m having through the
                        people who are, for the people who are listening to that. And getting a couple of emails from
                        people saying, &quot;Hey, [00:16:00] here&#39;s how your show impacted me&quot; that will keep
                        me charged up for weeks, versus just seeing download numbers go up or just seeing &nbsp;metrics
                        go up.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:16:08] That&#39;s fine. But that doesn&#39;t really charge me. But what
                        charges me is, on the other side of this is somebody who might be really struggling right now. I
                        just had to talk the other day with somebody from an organization who had invited me to come in
                        and speak to their organization. And this person was saying, &quot;I started listen to your
                        podcast and yeah, I was going through a season where I really needed someone who understood what
                        I was going through. And you were speaking directly to me. And now all these years later,
                        I&#39;m asking you to come speak to the organization that I work for because you were able to
                        help me in that time of need.&quot;</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:16:38] That&#39;s huge for me. Like just that number doesn&#39;t matter,
                        but just knowing that impact.Now for some people, to get back to &quot;Motivation Code&quot;,
                        for some people it&#39;s going to be like, let&#39;s say I&#39;m a podcaster. I need a team
                        because I&#39;m wired to collaborate, and I want to make sure that whatever I&#39;m doing with
                        other people.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:16:55] So for that person it&#39;s more about, the collective team effort
                        of putting a podcast into the world, or sharing our ideas with other people. For some people who
                        might be driven to comprehend and express, for them it might be, &quot;I want to learn new
                        things all the time and then share those things with people&quot;, and that&#39;s what drives
                        them. That&#39;s the satisfaction they get. Any number of people could be driven to do the same
                        thing for very different reasons, depending on where they get their motivational energy. Yeah,
                        but for me, it&#39;s reconnecting with the personal stories of people who have been impacted by
                        what I&#39;m doing.</span></p>
            <h3>COVID Themes</h3>
            <p class="c0"><span>[00:17:26] </span><span class="c3">Simon Yost: </span><span class="c2">[00:17:26] And
                        then, just to touch on COVID a little bit, it seems like you&#39;ve at least heard from a few
                        practitioners or folks that follow you that are connected with the creative community, over the
                        course of COVID have you heard any themes that have come out, good or bad, of how their world is
                        changing, or how they&#39;ve had to reframe?</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span>[00:17:43] </span><span class="c1">Todd Henry: </span><span class="c2">[00:17:43] Yeah,
                        I just finished doing a series of live workshops online for people called &quot;Creative Leader
                        Round Table&quot;. And the consistent theme was, there&#39;s, it&#39;s difficult because
                        everything feels transactional right now. Zoom calls feel transactional, it&#39;s not like
                        we&#39;re in the same space, doesn&#39;t feel like we have [00:18:00] relationship. It feels
                        like we&#39;re going to get online and do this transaction. And then, yeah, jump off. And so,
                        it&#39;s just hard to build any kind of team culture right now. It&#39;s hard to create an
                        environment because, and also the other thing to remember is everybody&#39;s in different
                        places. Like, some people maybe lost a loved one to all this madness. Some people might be
                        really struggling with a lot of the &nbsp;justice issues that are going on in our culture right
                        now, and struggling in the way that some other people maybe aren&#39;t as much. People have
                        different perspectives on that stuff. We&#39;re in the midst of political turmoil. As we&#39;re
                        speaking right now, we just found out the president of United States has tested positive for
                        COVID. Everything&#39;s coming at us so fast right now, and that it feels like that anxiety is
                        bubbling just beneath the surface all the time. And so, the question becomes, &quot;How do
                        we,how do we structure our lives to ensure that we have the space, the focus, the energy that we
                        need to be able to bring our best work to the table every day?&quot;</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:18:59] And those rhythms are going to look very different now than they
                        did six months ago , , because we&#39;re, I think six months ago, everybody was thinking,
                        &quot;Man, if I could just work from home all the time, that would be awesome. If I could work
                        in my pajamas all day and never had to change and go.&quot; And I think a lot of people right
                        now are thinking, &quot;Man, if I could just get in the car and drive to an office and sit at a
                        desk all day and be around people, that would be amazing.&quot; It&#39;s funny how our
                        perspective has changed now that we&#39;re doing this; we realize, &quot;Oh, maybe somewhere in
                        the middle is actually a better solution. Maybe one day at home, a week, or something.&quot; But
                        we just, we don&#39;t realize how much we need that. And so that&#39;s the consistent theme
                        I&#39;m hearing is that the anxiety is, we didn&#39;t realize how much it&#39;s been stolen from
                        us until we&#39;d been doing this for a while. And I think right now, many people are starting
                        to feel the tension of just the anxiety that&#39;s bubbling beneath the surface
                        constantly.</span></p>
            <h3>Tips for flowstate at home.</h3>

                        I know that a lot of your work talks about rhythms, &nbsp;and you mentioned that the rhythms are
                        going to change. I&#39;ve noticed even in my work that, sometimes it&#39;s hard to get into
                        [00:20:00] a flow state. Like I just, I&#39;m task-switching more. Have you, I know you&#39;ve
                        worked from home and stuff for a long time, do you have any tips for bouncing between meetings
                        and stuff like that? How do you frame that up for yourself?</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span>[00:20:12] </span><span class="c1">Todd Henry: </span><span class="c2">[00:20:12] Yeah.
                        Time blocking is the thing to do. Every day I have, I&#39;ll show you actually. I&#39;ve never
                        done this before, but I do it on my iPad, but I&#39;ve got these little daily plan sheets that I
                        use. You probably can&#39;t see that very well, but I use these little plan sheets and you, my
                        days are blocked off fo r different kinds of tasks.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:20:31] And I sort of &nbsp;keep a record of kind of what I&#39;m doing,
                        what my ambitions are for the day, all that kind of stuff , and time blocking is the only way
                        I&#39;ve found to do that. You have to block time off for the things that matter. So if you want
                        to get into flow state, number one our team has discovered in a lot of its research, that
                        there&#39;s a high degree of correlation between operating and your motivation code and
                        experiencing flow, so that&#39;s one thing. If you&#39;re operating in that core motivation,
                        you&#39;re more likely to experience that state of flow, which is incredible. But second, if you
                        want to get into flow, it&#39;s going to take time, and space, and focus. So you need to block
                        off chunks of time for doing what Cal Newport calls &quot;deep work&quot;, if you want to really
                        get into those states.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span>[00:21:13] </span><span class="c3">Simon Yost: </span><span class="c2">[00:21:13] Great.
                        Yeah. Do you have anything else you want to talk about the book or anything else that I missed?
                  </span></p>

                        just think, the problems we&#39;re facing today are not going to be solved by people phoning it
                        in. And so, we need all of us to better understand who we are, what drives us, how we can
                        position ourselves to be ready to deliver at a moment&#39;s notice what it is that&#39;s
                        required of us.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:21:31] And the only way really to do that is to understand what drives
                        you and then to bring that energy through your work every day, instead of waiting for your work
                        to energize you, which is probably not going to happen, unless you understand what it is that
                        really drives you. So that would be, I guess the only other thing I would offer.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">[00:21:45] And if you want to learn your motivation code, you can do with
                        motivationcode.com or you could read the book &quot;The Motivation Code&quot;. Available
                        now.</span></p>
