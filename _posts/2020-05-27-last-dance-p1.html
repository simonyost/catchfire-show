<p>Episode 2 is about archetypes and why they are failing us. Catch Fire Show is about moving past our archetypes to define your prototype. We all love archetypes. For example, many people, when they’re younger might aspire to be a teacher, pharmacist, fireman, or lawyer. These archetypes seem tangible, and I believe they are currently failing us.</p>

<p>I started to think about this years ago, when I was coaching people and continued when I was teaching at the university level. For me, then where the real rubber met the road was when I became a foster adopt dad of teenagers and my wife and I started to discuss what it looked like for them to launch.</p>

<p>After working with professionals that have come out of university, after teaching at the university level, and now looking to prepare my kids to go into the world and become adults, I don’t believe college as a milestone, as a season of life, is now robust enough to encompass all of our kiddos becoming adults. And I don’t think talking about college as the season of life is the way we can best help our kids anymore.</p>

<p>When I look back at my story, I’m not convinced that college is where I learned how I want to contribute. And so, we’re not saying college is bad, but we want to work on a framework. We’re calling it a contribution model that is more universal, so it can work with college and without college, that college could be a piece of that model for certain people, but not a mandatory piece of it for everybody.</p>
