### Quick Hits

- *Why did you start Sk8bort?* "In 2015, I transitioned from baseball. My Twitter name was YoupitchIhit because a baseball guy, I played DH. But I changed my name to Sk8bort, and that's how it all started. It was inspiration from Beyonce because in her song "Drunk in Love" she was like 'riding with my surfboard,' but nah, we skateboarding out here!"
