<blockquote>"When we got out of high school, it was kinda like it's over, but with Sideways, it's not just like 5 people.. it's all of us. It's a collective, basically. Whoever wants to be helping out with it can. If you get a photo or a clip, you're a part of it."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This isn't the first time I've done a type of brand thing. This is my friends from high school who I skated with. We got our whole crew together and made a thing called 'make-believe skateboards.' We made t-shirts and shit and made a bunch of edits."</blockquote>
