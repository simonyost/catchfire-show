As a fine artist and graphic designer, David Dolak welcomes any opportunity to think and create, whether it’s in his studio or with the talented team at Phoenix Creative. As Partner and Chief Creative Officer, he finds nothing more rewarding than helping create singular creative solutions that accomplish his clients’ goals. David has put his talent for advertising and passion for design to work for national accounts including Anheuser-Busch In-Bev, Chick-fil-A, SeaWorld, and Busch Gardens. If you keep an eye out, you might catch David’s work, not just on billboards and print ads, but in local fine-art galleries as well.
