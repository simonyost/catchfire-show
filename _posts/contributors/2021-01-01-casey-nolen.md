Casey Nolen is an experienced reporter and anchor whose work has earned the Edward R. Murrow Award and six Mid-America Emmy Awards for visual journalism - ranging from in-depth reporting to craft editing. He is known for fairness and context. The nerve to hold the powerful accountable and the empathy to tell the stories of the voiceless. And, if there’s a ‘big story’ Casey is there - from scoops in statewide politics to overseas Olympic coverage.
