               <p>On November 5, 2020, Catch Fire Show will host a Virtual Hamilton Experience. It will be an hour of
                  live discussion with three broadway cast members.</p>
               <p>Just like an episode of Catch Fire Show, Simon will interview Gregory, Julia, and Anthony live. Unlike
                  a typical episode, there will not be recording, and only 100 people can participate.

                  100 seats.</p>
