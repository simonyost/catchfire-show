  review: I’ve been lucky enough to know Simon for a few years now. He’s a thoughtful, compassionate, and knowledgable mentor. I learned a lot about my work and myself while working with him. Fast forward to a few years later and Simon’s still someone I can turn to and I am grateful.

  review: Simon has been a key influencer in my personal and professional growth. Somehow he knew I’d be a great developer way before I did. I remember sitting at lunch dismissing his suggestion to look into coding (I was going to be a famous music producer.) A few years later I was starting my first development job.
