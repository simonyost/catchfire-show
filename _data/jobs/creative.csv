We all know someone that has struggled with mental health - 1 in 4 people have a treatable mental health condition - but the overwhelming majority don’t get the care they need. The primary reason is cost - seventy percent of therapists don’t accept insurance, meaning paying for therapy is usually very, very expensive. Headway is building the first national, virtual network of therapists who accept insurance, helping providers to expand their practices, and individuals to finally find a therapist they can afford. And we’re doing it all through software. We launched in April of 2019 and are already powering thousands of therapy appointments every single day. To scale our mission, we’ve raised funding from the world’s preeminent VCs (backers of Facebook, LinkedIn, Slack, Uber, Oscar) as well as the nation’s most innovative healthcare entrepreneurs (founders of One Medical, Flatiron Health, and Clover Health). We believe a team's strength is in its people. Headway is solving a national problem of affordability, and we know this cannot be achieved without a team that reflects the diversity of this problem - across race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and experience. Join us, and make an impact. The Role Headway is looking for our first marketing hire to help us experiment our way into finding repeatable and scalable channels for generating a high volume of qualified therapist leads. From experimenting with Facebook ads to building growth product, you’ll work closely with Headway’s cofounder and Head of Growth to traverse multiple channels to help us find the 2-3 biggest, most efficient ones that can drive rapid growth and scale on the supply side of our marketplace. As our first growth marketing hire, you’ll define what exceptional looks like in this role and in the process pave the way for the marketing function at Headway. You'll be a great fit if You have 2-4 years of experience in growth marketing or growth product at a venture-backed startup, ideally a marketplace or SaaS business You have a deep understanding of digital marketing channels and funnel optimization You are deeply analytical: You can quickly size channels and opportunities, analyze results of an experiment to separate signal from noise and engage quantitatively to make recommendations about where we should invest or descope You are off the charts scrappy: You love rolling up your sleeves and executing on experiments. Whether it’s writing copy for landing pages or talking to therapists to conduct user research, you’re as comfortable executing as you are strategizing.

The primary reason is cost - seventy percent of therapists don’t accept insurance, meaning paying for therapy is usually very, very expensive.<br><br>Headway is building the first national, virtual network of therapists who accept insurance, helping providers to expand their practices, and individuals to finally find a therapist they can afford. And we’re doing it all through software.<br><br>We launched in April of 2019 and are already powering thousands of therapy appointments every single day. To scale our mission, we’ve raised funding from the world’s preeminent VCs (backers of Facebook, LinkedIn, Slack, Uber, Oscar) as well as the nation’s most innovative healthcare entrepreneurs (founders of One Medical, Flatiron Health, and Clover Health).<br><br>We believe a team's strength is in its people. Headway is solving a national problem of affordability, and we know this cannot be achieved without a team that reflects the diversity of this problem - across race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and experience.<br><br>Join us, and make an impact.<br><br>The Role<br><br>Headway is looking for our first marketing hire to help us experiment our way into finding repeatable and scalable channels for generating a high volume of qualified therapist leads. From experimenting with Facebook ads to building growth product, you’ll work closely with Headway’s cofounder and Head of Growth to traverse multiple channels to help us find the 2-3 biggest, most efficient ones that can drive rapid growth and scale on the supply side of our marketplace. As our first growth marketing hire, you’ll define what exceptional looks like in this role and in the process pave the way for the marketing function at Headway.<br><br><strong>You'll be a great fit if<br></strong><ul><ul><li>You have 2-4 years of experience in growth marketing or growth product at a venture-backed startup, ideally a marketplace or SaaS business</li><li>You have a deep understanding of digital marketing channels and funnel optimization</li><li>You are deeply analytical: You can quickly size channels and opportunities, analyze results of an experiment to separate signal from noise and engage quantitatively to make recommendations about where we should invest or descope</li><li>You are off the charts scrappy: You love rolling up your sleeves and executing on experiments.
