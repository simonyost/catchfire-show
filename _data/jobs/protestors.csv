Please reach out to jobs@sailpoint.com for additional details.** *SailPoint is based in Austin, TX. We are open to remote candidates for this role. You are an amazing software engineer, a canny technical leader, and a shrewd software architect. You know not only how to write scalable SaaS services from the ground up using proven technologies, but you have been around the block many times with several teams, and you can see the traps laid before engineers trying to build a new system. You love to coach those engineers, to guide them into becoming thoughtful, self-starting contributors who have a bigger and bigger impact on the organization. You think that carefully deciding not to write code is an effective use of your time, and you love nothing more than deleting code. At SailPoint, we are building the most comprehensive suite of identity governance & management SaaS products in the world. Built from the ground up on a microservices, multi-tenant architecture, we enable customers to connect all of their relevant business applications, and then provide them the tools to effectively manage and govern those identities and access controls. The Platform team’s mission is to create a series of solid foundations on which our products can be built, including things like a common microservices architecture, a robust event bus, rich search capabilities, global authentication, authorization and API routing, among others. In this role, you will spend much of your time understanding business problems and shared engineering desires across teams to collaborate, debate, design, prototype, implement and mentor other engineers in the creation (or avoidance) of software. Your ability to build trusting relationships through use of your expertise and careful listening to stakeholders and your team will be paramount to success in this role. In turn, you will receive thoughtful critique, direct coaching and opportunities to have a large impact on the entire engineering organization, along with our team of software architects. Responsibilities: Seek to deeply understand business problems or common engineering challenges and propose software architecture designs to solve them elegantly by abstracting useful common patterns. Proactively collaborate on, discuss, debate and refine ideas, problem statements, and software designs with different (sometimes many) stakeholders, architects and members of your team. Take a committed approach to prototyping and co-implementing systems alongside less experienced engineers on your team—there’s no room for ivory towers here. Share support of critical team systems by participating in on-call rotations, learning the characteristics of currently running systems, and participating in improvements. Occasionally serve as a debugging and implementation expert during escalations of systems issues that have evaded the ability of less experienced engineers to solve in a timely manner. Requirements: Deep implementation experience in Java for 3+ years, with a recent version of Java A positive and collaborative demeanor, combined with a love for teaching 10+ years of overall professional software development experience 3+ years of experience leading systems design 3+ years of professional experience writing software on a modern stack different from Java 2+ years of professional experience in a multiple-stakeholder environment A proven ability to change your own opinions and preferred methods based on new evidence Truly excellent written & verbal communication skills, including the art of being concise Pluses (or Things You’ll Learn on the Job): Deep experience with the Go programming language Building shared systems, frameworks, libraries and tools as part of a platform team Experience building data ingest pipelines from varied sources into a common data processing architecture SailPoint is an equal opportunity employer and we welcome everyone to our team.  All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or veteran status.",Full Time,,Linkedin,,1606744831978472,jobs@sailpoint.com,,19e440650bdfaf7267109564dd79a246,"<p><strong>**This opportunity is open to remote and/or relocation.

Please reach out to jobs@sailpoint.com for additional details.** *SailPoint is based in Austin, TX. We are open to remote candidates for this role. You are an amazing software engineer, a canny technical leader, and a shrewd software architect. You know not only how to write scalable SaaS services from the ground up using proven technologies, but you have been around the block many times with several teams, and you can see the traps laid before engineers trying to build a new system. You love to coach those engineers, to guide them into becoming thoughtful, self-starting contributors who have a bigger and bigger impact on the organization. You think that carefully deciding not to write code is an effective use of your time, and you love nothing more than deleting code. At SailPoint, we are building the most comprehensive suite of identity governance & management SaaS products in the world. Built from the ground up on a microservices, multi-tenant architecture, we enable customers to connect all of their relevant business applications, and then provide them the tools to effectively manage and govern those identities and access controls. The Platform team’s mission is to create a series of solid foundations on which our products can be built, including things like a common microservices architecture, a robust event bus, rich search capabilities, global authentication, authorization and API routing, among others. In this role, you will spend much of your time understanding business problems and shared engineering desires across teams to collaborate, debate, design, prototype, implement and mentor other engineers in the creation (or avoidance) of software. Your ability to build trusting relationships through use of your expertise and careful listening to stakeholders and your team will be paramount to success in this role. In turn, you will receive thoughtful critique, direct coaching and opportunities to have a large impact on the entire engineering organization, along with our team of software architects. Responsibilities: Seek to deeply understand business problems or common engineering challenges and propose software architecture designs to solve them elegantly by abstracting useful common patterns. Proactively collaborate on, discuss, debate and refine ideas, problem statements, and software designs with different (sometimes many) stakeholders, architects and members of your team. Take a committed approach to prototyping and co-implementing systems alongside less experienced engineers on your team—there’s no room for ivory towers here. Share support of critical team systems by participating in on-call rotations, learning the characteristics of currently running systems, and participating in improvements. Occasionally serve as a debugging and implementation expert during escalations of systems issues that have evaded the ability of less experienced engineers to solve in a timely manner. Requirements: Deep implementation experience in Java for 3+ years, with a recent version of Java A positive and collaborative demeanor, combined with a love for teaching 10+ years of overall professional software development experience 3+ years of experience leading systems design 3+ years of professional experience writing software on a modern stack different from Java 2+ years of professional experience in a multiple-stakeholder environment A proven ability to change your own opinions and preferred methods based on new evidence Truly excellent written & verbal communication skills, including the art of being concise Pluses (or Things You’ll Learn on the Job): Deep experience with the Go programming language Building shared systems, frameworks, libraries and tools as part of a platform team Experience building data ingest pipelines from varied sources into a common data processing architecture SailPoint is an equal opportunity employer and we welcome everyone to our team.  All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or veteran status.",Full Time,,Linkedin,,1606744833060918,jobs@sailpoint.com,,d388fdbc5650eae3cf82a92c00b3b150,"<p><strong>**This opportunity is open to remote and/or relocation.

Please reach out to jobs@sailpoint.com for additional details.** *SailPoint is based in Austin, TX. We are open to remote candidates for this role. You are an amazing software engineer, a canny technical leader, and a shrewd software architect. You know not only how to write scalable SaaS services from the ground up using proven technologies, but you have been around the block many times with several teams, and you can see the traps laid before engineers trying to build a new system. You love to coach those engineers, to guide them into becoming thoughtful, self-starting contributors who have a bigger and bigger impact on the organization. You think that carefully deciding not to write code is an effective use of your time, and you love nothing more than deleting code. At SailPoint, we are building the most comprehensive suite of identity governance & management SaaS products in the world. Built from the ground up on a microservices, multi-tenant architecture, we enable customers to connect all of their relevant business applications, and then provide them the tools to effectively manage and govern those identities and access controls. The Platform team’s mission is to create a series of solid foundations on which our products can be built, including things like a common microservices architecture, a robust event bus, rich search capabilities, global authentication, authorization and API routing, among others. In this role, you will spend much of your time understanding business problems and shared engineering desires across teams to collaborate, debate, design, prototype, implement and mentor other engineers in the creation (or avoidance) of software. Your ability to build trusting relationships through use of your expertise and careful listening to stakeholders and your team will be paramount to success in this role. In turn, you will receive thoughtful critique, direct coaching and opportunities to have a large impact on the entire engineering organization, along with our team of software architects. Responsibilities: Seek to deeply understand business problems or common engineering challenges and propose software architecture designs to solve them elegantly by abstracting useful common patterns. Proactively collaborate on, discuss, debate and refine ideas, problem statements, and software designs with different (sometimes many) stakeholders, architects and members of your team. Take a committed approach to prototyping and co-implementing systems alongside less experienced engineers on your team—there’s no room for ivory towers here. Share support of critical team systems by participating in on-call rotations, learning the characteristics of currently running systems, and participating in improvements. Occasionally serve as a debugging and implementation expert during escalations of systems issues that have evaded the ability of less experienced engineers to solve in a timely manner. Requirements: Deep implementation experience in Java for 3+ years, with a recent version of Java A positive and collaborative demeanor, combined with a love for teaching 10+ years of overall professional software development experience 3+ years of experience leading systems design 3+ years of professional experience writing software on a modern stack different from Java 2+ years of professional experience in a multiple-stakeholder environment A proven ability to change your own opinions and preferred methods based on new evidence Truly excellent written & verbal communication skills, including the art of being concise Pluses (or Things You’ll Learn on the Job): Deep experience with the Go programming language Building shared systems, frameworks, libraries and tools as part of a platform team Experience building data ingest pipelines from varied sources into a common data processing architecture SailPoint is an equal opportunity employer and we welcome everyone to our team.  All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or veteran status.",Full Time,,Linkedin,,1606744834099017,jobs@sailpoint.com,,28eb26eaa7c77d152ba9b0480e48e30f,"<p><strong>**This opportunity is open to remote and/or relocation.
