We welcome candidates who can contribute to the diversity and excellence of our academic community. Description: Dr. Anne Piantadosi’s laboratory at the Emory University School of Medicine is seeking an inquisitive, highly-motivated postdoctoral researcher with expertise in computational biology to study the genomics of emerging viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The repeated and unpredictable threat of emerging viruses is evident in the spread of known viruses, such as dengue virus, and the identification of new viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2.

It guides fundamental work ranging from viral discovery to studies of pathogenicity, and directly informs the treatment and prevention of disease. We are a nimble, closely-knit research team, large enough to accomplish great work, yet small enough to ensure that each member has the mentorship needed to grow toward their next career goal. Our current active projects include studying the diversity and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, dengue virus, and Powassan virus. We also use metagenomic sequencing to detect and discover unappreciated/novel viruses in patients and mosquito/tick vectors. Our projects combine clinical, laboratory, and computational approaches, and we are delighted to collaborate closely with clinicians and researchers across a wide spectrum of expertise on projects with high importance to patient care and public health. The candidate for this position will have the opportunity to lead computational projects investigating population-level virus evolution, within-host virus evolution, and/or metagenomics/virome studies. In addition to planning, conducting, and publishing research, they will contribute to the professional development of undergraduate and graduate students, and work closely with research associates in the wet lab to ensure projects proceed smoothly. This position benefits from the rich academic environment of the Emory School of Medicine, Emory University, the Yerkes National Primate Research Center, and the Emory Vaccine Center. There is ample opportunity for high-impact projects, facilitated by our existing collaborations, close integration with clinical laboratories, and advanced molecular wet lab. Qualifications: PhD in bioinformatics, computational biology, evolutionary biology, virology or related. The ideal candidate will have a background in phylogenetics and/or metagenomics. A track record of outstanding written and verbal communication Superior organizational skills Experience working with massively parallel sequencing data Experience working on cloud platforms Proficiency with command-line Linux/UNIX systems Use of basic software engineering practices such as version control A history of, or interest in, contributing to open-source software is beneficial. Experience with wet lab sequencing methods is highly beneficial. This is a two-year position, with potential for extension depending on funding. There is the opportunity to work remotely.

We’ve created the first chatbot that learns to talk to customers simply, without requiring laborious decision trees or extensively labeled training data. Statistics for our first cohort of customer deployments demonstrate that the Gamalon AI helps customers as well or better than a human chat rep. We’ve seen great success with early customers. We are now heading into rapid expansion. We are looking for an experienced software engineer with startup experience to work on our machine learning team to translate our unique approach and algorithms into well-designed customer facing code. Gamalon’s machine learning bridges the gap between laborious, fully supervised machine learning and powerful but difficult-to-control unsupervised learning. We’re committed to more easily-designed and robust conversational experiences. In most jobs, you work primarily to shepherd black box models; at Gamalon we empower software engineers to work inside the model. That means engaging with the important problems of what a model should learn and how it should behave. Members of our focused research team make impactful decisions about which problems to solve and how to build out these systems in a production environment. Gamalon was recognized by MIT Technology Review as one of the “50 Smartest Companies” for 2017 and by the World Economic Forum as a 2018 Technology Pioneer. We have filed 52 patents. Gamalon’s conversational AI products are based on a technology platform developed from over $35M of DARPA funded R&D in collaboration with Stanford and MIT, and a $20M Series A led by Intel Capital to commercialize the technology. Who You Are You are generous with others and collaborate well in a team environment. You are curious to learn more about advanced machine learning. You have made a measurable impact on a commercial code base, working in a startup or other highly dynamic environment. Strong interest in being part of one of the first teams building AI-first software products, collaborating with machine learning scientists as well as with product design.

You can demonstrate a facility for learning new programming languages and frameworks Strong ability to communicate ideas while writing, reviewing, and discussing technical specifications You are proficient in Python and can model good software practices You are based in the Boston area or willing to move. (Gamalon is remote-first due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but we have not made a decision to remain so.) You are authorized to work in the U.S. What You’ll Do You will sit on our product-focused development team, working with machine learning scientists, software engineers, and product leads to develop our IdeaFlow chat product Main responsibility is working collaboratively with the research team to move validated ideas and algorithms through to tested, production code. Frequently pair with research scientists to solve complex problems.

Solid experience iteratively designing and maintaining codebases for prototyping ideas. Work in an agile environment, rapidly delivering shippable features into production. Salary negotiable.
